Stock_Bot – This strategy sends a notification to my phone to purchase a stock once it’s MACD histogram value is decreasing for at least 50 minutes, and then goes up once during a 10-minute interval, so we know we are at a low. It also sends me a notification to sell off the stock once the MACD histogram value is increasing over that same period and goes down once during that same interval, so we know we are at a peak. Along with that, once the order is placed, we store the price that it was bought at. We use this to ensure a profit is made, and executing the sell If the current price is higher than when we bought it. The way we get the data is through the Robinhood API and a statistical analysis package called tulipy. In order for us to create MACD data, we must have access to the price of the stock over the last 26 days at 10 minute intervals. The prices we need at the interval we need them at is all provided to us by the Robinhood API. Finally using tulipy, we can construct our MACD data using their formula on all of the prices from Robinhood.
